# Bokeh/Flask Dashboard Example

Initial code taken from [dradecic on github](https://github.com/dradecic/Python-Bokeh-Flask--Dashboard-App). Dashboard application with interactive charts. 

Code refactored to separate routing and charting python scripts. CSS and HTML templates changed to improve mobile and desktop compatability.

Using generic titanic.csv dataset as demonstration.
